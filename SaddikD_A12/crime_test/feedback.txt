The feedback I provided: 

It looks good Aaminah, the READme file was helpful! 
The 8 tests ran smoothly, 
I think she might want us to actually use the dataset instead of our own 
samples but other than that I donâ€™t think there are any issues

The feedback I recieved:

Hi, I had unzipped the zip file containing the dataset so that the csv file was in the same folder 
as the other python files, but got this error when I tried running the unit_test.py file 
> SYNTAX ERROR (I attempted to correct it!)
